OpenCV4.1.1, Ubuntu 18.04, Python, CUDA.\
Pose Estimation of three poses has been done on Jetson Nano using OpenPose, Supervised Machine Learning Model and Raspberry Pi camera. \
Support Vector Machine Model has been used to predict poses using Raspberry Pi camera and a realtime feedback is provided to the user. \
Poses predicted:
1. Airplane Pose
2. Peter Pan
3. Raise Hand
